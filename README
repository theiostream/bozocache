## SUMMARY
** This requires "afc2add" to be installed from Cydia. **
USAGE: bozocache <path for shared cache output (assumes cwd/cache_name)>

## DESCRIPTION
Copying the dyld shared cache was the only reason I even got a program like iExplorer. I felt this was stupid and created this tool to get it.

Q: Why not use ssh?
A: You're not very experienced with this, apparently. Check https://github.com/kennytm/Miscellaneous/issues/1.

## BUILDING
1. git submodule update --init
2. make
3. sudo make install
